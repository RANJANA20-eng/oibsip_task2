# Introduction :
A model to predict the price of a used car should be developed in order to assess its value based on a variety of characteristics. Several factors affect the price of a used car, such as company, model, year, transmission, distance driven, fuel type, seller type, and owner type. As a result, it is crucial to know the car's actual market value before purchasing or selling it.
# Dataset :
The data we have used in this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho). It was uploaded from Cardekho.com . The dataset consists of 301 rows and 9 columns with no null values. Column data consist of independent Features. The independent features contain both categorical and numeric values.
# Business Goal :
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
# Steps :
1. Create a new Conda env
2. Training
3. Execution
4. Testing of Model
